            <br><br>
            The customer is entitled to 100% refund before our writers/editors start working on the project. If (for any
            reason) you change your mind and decide against continuing your project with us after placing your order,
            you can ask for refund within the first hour of placing your order. A 15% processing fee will be charged in
            other cases.

            <span class="fw_600 fs_18 color_2">Incompetent Delivery:</span>
            <br><br>
            Once the work is delivered, customers are only entitled to claim a refund once they have exhausted all the
            options detailed as under;
            <br><br>
            If it does not comply with project requirements (as requested/documented by the customer). We are committed
            to provide our customers with 100% satisfaction and offer unlimited revisions to ensure that the delivery is
            up to the mark. We assign, re-assign and re-write your work to ensure complete satisfaction. Reserve FREE
            Pages for future, but of same value and you can avail them at any time.
            <br><br>
            If we're still not able to deliver what you asked for, refund will be processed with a mutual agreement on a
            set percentage (but only in the cases where the delivery is completely off the mark)

            We believe in "On Time Delivery" but if, for any reason we fail to deliver the asked service on time, after
            at least three attempts to contact us, your refund will be processed once it is established through
            documentary evidence that the late delivery was the company’s fault.

            <span class="fs_18 fw_600 color_2">Cases where refund will not be issued</span>
            <br><br>
            In case of late delivery due to some minor technical errors, such as grammatical, typing, word count,
            missing references etc., refunds will be processed with mutual agreement and the company will only settle
            with partial refund or discounts reserved for future purchases.
            <br><br>
            The company will not be responsible for any delay from the client’s end. No refund will be issued on the
            basis of low of writing.
